"""A skeleton for a Python rsyslog output plugin with error handling.
Requires Python 3.

To integrate a plugin based on this skeleton with rsyslog, configure an
'omprog' action like the following:
    action(type="omprog"
        binary="/usr/bin/myplugin.py"
        output="/var/log/myplugin.log"
        confirmMessages="on"

    An example of such an error would be a temporary loss of connection to
    a database or a server. If such an error occurs in the onMessage function,
    your plugin should wrap it in a RecoverableError before raising it.
    For example:
