# SecureDrop Community Code of Conduct

## Preamble

Like the broader technical and activism communities as a whole, the SecureDrop
community is made up of a mixture of staff and volunteers from all over the world,
engaged in various activities—including operations, software
development, mentorship, and building connections with great people and
organizations.

To work together effectively in a large, diverse and open community, we have a
few ground rules that we expect everyone to adhere to, be it paid staff and
board members, volunteers and event attendees; mentors, veterans, novices, or
those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended: a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events under the responsibility of someone who belongs to the
SecureDrop Community. This includes physical offices, GitHub repositories, online chat
systems, the Support Forum, SecureDrop hosted or sponsored events, and any other
forums created by the SecureDrop Community which are used for communication.
In addition, we take violations of this code outside these spaces into account
when determining a person's ability to participate within them.

## Summary

The SecureDrop Community should be a place where people feel safe and welcome.
They should enjoy participating in discussions and contributing. To these ends,
members of the community should:

- Be friendly and patient
- Assume good faith and good intentions
- Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful
- Be careful in the words they choose
- Listen to each other, and communicate openly and honestly

Members of the community should not:

- Intimidate, harass, or insult each other
- Follow the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit

Members of the community should not hesitate to contact the Community Moderation
and Safety Team ("Community Team") if they feel someone has violated this Code of
Conduct, or if they have questions or concerns.

## Behavioral Guidelines

As a member of the community, you are expected to:

- Be friendly and patient. Your work will be used by other people, and you in
  turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect
  human beings, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that our community is international, and that the people
  you interact with may be communicating with you in a language that is not
  their native tongue.

- Assume good faith and good intentions. Disagreements — both social and
  technical — happen all the time. Our diverse backgrounds give us the ability
  to see things from many different perspectives, but they can also lead to
  misunderstandings. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  constructively, and that we do not jump to conclusions about each other's
  motives.

- Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful. We strive to be a community that
  welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
  but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
  origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
  level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size,
  family status, political belief, religion and mental and physical ability.

- Be careful in the words you choose. Exclusionary behavior is absolutely
  unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Discriminatory (e.g., racist or sexist) jokes and language
  - Inappropriate names for user accounts, servers, files, repositories, etc.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
  - Personal insults
  - Misgendering or deadnaming
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

- Listen and communicate openly and honestly. Yield the floor to
  others, and help to make sure that everyone gets heard. In other words, try to
  be your best self. In doing so, you contribute the health and longevity of
  this community.

As a member of the SecureDrop Community, you are expected to never engage in the
following behaviors:

- Intimidation, harassments, or insults.  This includes but is not limited to:
  - Physical intimidation or threats against someone's physical safety
  - Obscene or intimidating gestures
  - Stalking
  - Demeaning another person
  - Unwelcome following
  - Enlisting the help of others, whether in person or online, in order to
    target an individual
  - Taking photographs, video, or audio recordings or recordings without consent
  - Shouting
  - Sustained disruption of talks and events
  - Disruption of meetings
  - Inappropriate physical contact
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing")
  - Violation of people's stated personal boundaries

- Following the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit.
  When judging whether certain behavior represents a violation of this code, we
  will consider a violation in spirit (e.g., clearly behaving in a damaging or
  obnoxious manner in a way not explicitly specified) to be no different from
  any other violation of this code. That includes trolling and other forms of
  consistently disruptive behavior.

## Enforcement

We do not tolerate unacceptable behavior from any community member, and there
are no exceptions for those in positions of power such as maintainers,
sponsors, funders, or other individuals with decision making authority.
Further, people in positions of power can wield it to exacerbate the effects of
harassment and to diminish the repercussions. For these reasons, those who are
informal or formal leaders are held to a higher standard.

Anyone asked by another community member to stop unacceptable behavior is
expected to comply immediately. However, you should not step in on someone
else's behalf without their consent.

### How to get help

The Community Team is made up established members of the community who
assist with resolving conflicts within the community.

Currently the Community Team consists of:

- Jen Helsby (`@redshiftzero`) - Principal Research Engineer - [jen@freedom.press](mailto:jen@freedom.press)
- Mickael E. (`@emkll`) - Lead Engineer - [mickael@freedom.press](mailto:mickael@freedom.press)

You can contact the whole Community Team or members individually.

You should contact the Community Team if you have questions or concerns about
the Code of Conduct (including improvements) or if you feel that you have
witnessed a Code of Conduct violation. In the even of a violation either
directed at yourself or someone else, please contact the Community Team as
soon as possible through whatever analog or digital medium you are most
comfortable with.

Should your report be about any member of the Community Team or if there is a
conflict of interest, that member will recuse themselves from the conflict
resolution proceedings. They will not be involved with the discussion,
documentation, communications, or decisions made by the rest of the Community
Team with regards to the incident.

## What the person reporting a violation can expect

The Community Team will respond to reports as quickly as possible. When
responding to a report, the Community Team will prioritize the safety of the
person(s) who have been harmed or are at risk of harm and the reporter(s). No
actions will be taken without the consent of the person who has been harmed or
is at risk of harm except in cases where danger or harm are imminent.

All reports to the Community Team, no matter how minor or severe, will be
taken seriously and looked into.

## How the Community Team responds to incidents

The Community Team does not have a fixed of set responses to some enumerated
set of incidents that may occur. The Community Team operates on a
case-by-case basis taking into account past behavior; the relationship between
the person(s) who were harmed and the person(s) causing the harm; the responses
of the person(s) who caused harm; and the perceived threat of future harm.

Actions the Community Team may take to mitigate harm include, but are not
limited to:

- A simple warning
- Informal mediation
- A temporary ban from email lists, chat channels, repositories, or other online
  communication mediums
- A temporary ban from events or community spaces
- Permanent expulsion from the community

Once the Community Team has reached a decision on how to mitigate the harm or
risk of harm, the person(s) on the receiving end of the mitigation(s) may appeal
the decision by writing or otherwise communicating with the Community Team.
