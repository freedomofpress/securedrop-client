# Mailcap acts as a fallback mechanism if MIME type lookup fails in tools like
# xdg-open. Because the Mailcap MIME type definitions do not match the
# ones used by the SecureDrop Workstation, we disable Mailcap for the default
# user using a wildcard rule. Lookup attempts are logged to /var/log/syslog
# and sd-log.
