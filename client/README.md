# securedrop-client

The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the [SecureDrop Workstation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation).

The client runs within a [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/) VM that has no direct network access and opens files within individual, non-networked, disposable VMs. API requests and responses to and from the [SecureDrop application server](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/glossary.html#application-server) are sent through an intermediate VM using the [SecureDrop Proxy](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-proxy).

To learn more about architecture and our rationale behind our Qubes OS approach, see the [SecureDrop Workstation readme](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation/blob/main/README.md).

**IMPORTANT:** This project is currently undergoing a pilot study and should not be used in production environments.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with running the client is to use the [developer environment](#developer-environment) that [runs against a test server running in a local docker container](#running-against-a-test-server). This differs from a staging or production environment where the client receives and sends requests over Tor. Things are a lot snappier in the developer environment and can sometimes lead to a much different user experience, which is why it is important to do end-to-end testing in Qubes using the [staging environment](#staging-environment), especially if you are modifying code paths involving how we handle server requests and responses.

For reproducing production bugs or running demos, we recommend using the [Production Environment](#production-environment) that will allow you to test a nightly build of the client.

We support running the [developer environment on a non-Qubes OS](#developer-environment-on-a-non-qubes-os) for developer convenience. If this is your preferred environment, keep in mind that you, or a PR reviewer, will need to run tests in Qubes if you modify code paths involving any of the following:

* cryptography
* opening of files in VMs
* network (via the RPC service) traffic
* fine tuning of the graphical user interface

### Running against a test server

In order to login, or take other actions involving network access, you will need to run the client against a SecureDrop server. If you don't have a production server or want to test against a test server, you can install a SecureDrop server inside a dev container by following the instructions [in the SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html#quick-start).

The client uses the [SecureDrop SDK](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-sdk) to interact with the [SecureDrop Journalist API](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/journalist_api.html). After you run the server container, the journalist interface API will be running on `127.0.0.1:8081` with a test journalist, admin, and test sources and replies.

To ensure that file decryption works, please import [this test private key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/0a901362b84a5378fba80e9cd0ffe4542bdcd598/securedrop/tests/files/test_journalist_key.sec) into your GnuPG keyring. Submissions in the SecureDrop server dev environment can be decrypted with this test key.

### Developer environment

Running the client in a developer environment will use a temporary directory as its configuration directory, instead of ` ~/.securedrop_client`. A development gpg private key inside a gpg keychain is stored in the temporary configuration directory, which will be used to decrypt messages sent from the server running in the local docker container.

The SecureDrop client will open or export file submissions within disposable AppVms.

Tor is not used in the developer environment. If you want to use a Tor connection between the client and server, then you'll need to follow the [staging environment](#staging-environment) instructions instead.

1. Open a terminal in the `sd-app` AppVM in Qubes

2. Run a SecureDrop server in a local docker container

See [SecureDrop docs](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html) for setup instructions, including post-installation steps for allowing docker to be run as a non-root user, which is a requirement on Qubes.

3. In a new terminal tab, clone the SecureDrop Client repo and install its dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-client.git
cd securedrop-client
poetry install
```

   * You will need Python 3.11 to run the client. If it's not the default `python3` on your installation, you can set `poetry env use python3.11`.

4. Run SecureDrop Client

```
./run.sh
```

Or, if you want to persist data across restarts, you will need to run the client with:

```
./run.sh --sdc-home /path/to/my/configuration/directory
```

### Developer environment on a Linux-based non-Qubes OS

Running the client in a developer environment will use a temporary directory as its configuration directory, instead of ` ~/.securedrop_client`. A development gpg private key inside a gpg keychain is stored in the temporary configuration directory, which will be used to decrypt messages.

If you want to be able to open or export file submissions in a disposable AppVM, then you'll need to follow the instructions for running this in a [developer environment](#developer-environment) in Qubes.

Tor is not used in the developer environment. If you want to use a Tor connection between the client and server, then you'll need to follow the [staging environment](#staging-environment) instructions instead.

1. Open a terminal from your non-Qubes OS

2. Run a SecureDrop server in a local docker container

See [SecureDrop docs](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html) for setup instructions.

3. In a new terminal tab, clone the SecureDrop Client repo and install its dependencies

```
git clone git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-client.git
cd securedrop-client
poetry install
```

4. Run SecureDrop Client

```
./run.sh
```

Or, if you want to persist data across restarts, you will need to run the client with:

```
./run.sh --sdc-home /path/to/my/configuration/directory
```


### Developer environment on macOS

It is possible to run the development environment in macOS systems, but some functionality may not be available:
 * If you want to be able to open or export file submissions in a disposable AppVM, then you'll need to follow the instructions for running this in a [developer environment](#developer-environment) in Qubes.
 * Tor is not used in the developer environment. If you want to use a Tor connection between the client and server, then you'll need to follow the [staging environment](#staging-environment) instructions instead.

#### Set up the server
1. Open a terminal in macOS (note: this terminal must be a login shell - check your terminal app preferences)

2. Run a SecureDrop server in a local docker container:

   1. If it is not already installed, install Docker following instructions from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
   2. Clone the securedrop repo: `git clone git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop.git`
   3. Start the development server: `cd securedrop && make dev`. The Source Interface will now be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

  See [SecureDrop docs](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html) for more info and troubleshooting steps if necessary.

Alternatively, if you can run or access a SecureDrop development environment on a remote server `A.B.C.D`, you can use the following command to set up a proxy to that remote server rather than running it locally:

```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8081,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:A.B.C.D:8081
```

#### Set up the SecureDrop Client
1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Install Homebrew
  a. If you use an Intel based machine, follow the instructions at https://brew.sh/
  b. If you use an Apple Silicon based machine (M1 or M2 Macs):
    1. (Informational) If you already have a native `arm64` version of Homebrew, you will wind up with a separate Homebrew installation for each architecture. While they do not conflict, combining them in your `PATH` permanently may cause confusion about which brews are installed where. You may want to modify your `PATH` temporarily to perform this installation. The environment you create in this session will continue to work in subsequent sessions.
    2. Run `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta` to allow you to run `x86_64` binaries
    3. Enter a shell in `x86_64` mode with `arch -x86_64 bash`
    4. Install Homebrew via the instructions at https://brew.sh/
    5. Install the dependencies below in the same `x86_64` shell session
3. Install dependencies via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.11 gnupg oath-toolkit`
4. clone the SecureDrop Client repo and install its dependencies
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-client.git
   cd securedrop-client
   poetry install
   ```

5. Run SecureDrop Client
   ```
   ./run.sh
   ```

To log in, use one of the journalist usernames/passwords displayed in the Docker server output, such as
`journalist/correct horse battery staple profanity oil chewy`. To generate the required 2FA token, use
the `oathtool` command, eg: `oathtool -b --totp "JHCOGO7VCER3EJ4L"` in your terminal.

Note: to persist data and config across multiple client runs, specify a home directory, e.g. `./run.sh --sdc_home=~/.sd_client`

### Staging environment

Running the SecureDrop client in a staging environment will use a `~/.securedrop_client` as its configuration directory. The gpg key in the `sd-gpg` AppVM configured during `make all` will be used to decrypt messages.

The SecureDrop client will open or export file submissions within disposable AppVms.

Requests and responses between the client and server use a Tor connection, which are proxied via the `securedrop-proxy` AppVM's RPC service.


1. Run a SecureDrop staging server

See [SecureDrop docs on setting up a staging server](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/virtual_environments.html#staging) or [SecureDrop docs on setting up a staging server in Qubes](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/qubes_staging.html#deploying-securedrop-staging-instance-on-qubes)

2. Open a terminal in `dom0` in Qubes

3. Create a `config.json` file

```
cd securedrop-workstation
cp config.json.example config.json
vi config.json
```

`config.json.example` already contains the staging server's submission key fingerprint (and `sd-journalist.sec` already contains the staging server's private submission key) so all you need to do is update the hidserv hostname and key in `config.json`. To find this information, you can run `sudo cat /var/lib/tor/services/journalist/hostname` on you staging server.

4. Run `make all` to configure the AppVms

5. Open a terminal in the `sd-app` AppVM

6. Initialize the SecureDrop Client database by running the installed client (e.g. nightly build) once by running:

```
securedrop-client
```

Or [manually initialize](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/blob/HEAD/files/securedrop-client) the SecureDrop Client database.

8. To run a different version of the client, say the version from a branch called `<branchname>`, first add a NetVM (`sys-firewall`) to `sd-app` via its Qubes Settings so you can clone the client repository, and then follow these steps:

```
sudo apt-get install git python3-poetry  # NB. won't persist across "sd-app" reboots
git clone -b <branchname> https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client.git
cd securedrop-client
poetry install
```

9. Run the client

```
poetry run securedrop_client
```

### Production environment

Running the SecureDrop client in a production environment will use a `~/.securedrop_client` as its configuration directory. The gpg key in the `sd-gpg` AppVM configured during `make all` will be used to decrypt messages.

The SecureDrop client will open or export file submissions within disposable AppVms.

Requests and responses between the client and server use a Tor connection, which are proxied via the `securedrop-proxy` AppVM's RPC service.

1. Run a SecureDrop server

See [SecureDrop docs on setting up a server](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/install.html)

2. Open a terminal in `dom0` in Qubes

3. Create a `config.json` file

```
cd securedrop-workstation
cp config.json.example config.json
vi config.json
```

Update the hidserv hostname and key in `config.json`. To find this information, you can run `sudo cat /var/lib/tor/services/journalist/hostname` on you staging server. Update the Submission Key fingerprint as well.

4. Create an `sd-journalist.sec` file

Create `sd-journalist.sec` in the `securedrop-workstation` directory in `dom0` and copy your server's private submission key to this file. You can find this key in `~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base` on the Tails drive you used to set up your SecureDrop server.

5. Run the nightly build of the client by double-clicking the SecureDrop shortcut on your Qubes Desktop

```
securedrop-client
```

## Updating dependencies

`pyproject.toml` and `Poetry.lock` point to hashes of artifacts hosted on PyPI, and `build-requirements.txt` points to our reproducible builds of the wheels (https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-builder/). Whenever a dependency in `build-requirements.txt` changes, our team needs to manually review the code in the dependency diff with a focus on spotting vulnerabilities.

If you're adding or updating a production dependency, you need to:

1. Modify `pyproject.toml`.
2. Build the relevant wheels in the `securedrop-builder` Git repository.
3. Synchronize `build-requirements.txt` with hashes of the newly built wheels.

## Generating and running database migrations

```bash
rm -f svs.sqlite
sqlite3 svs.sqlite .databases > /dev/null
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your revision here"
```

**NOTE.**  Schema migrations, data migrations, and tests [MUST] be self-contained.  That is, their `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` methods and their tests [MUST NOT] rely, directly or indirectly, on other project code, such as `db.py`'s SQLAlchemy models or other helper classes and functions defined outside of the migration under test, because these utilities may change in Git over time.  (The scaffolding of the `test_alembic.py` test suite [MAY] rely on such utilities, because it is versioned at the Git level, not the Alembic level.)  See [#1500](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/issues/1500) for an example of why this guideline applies.

## AppArmor support

An AppArmor profile is available for mandatory access control. When installing securedrop-client from a .deb package, the AppArmor profile will automatically be copied and enforced. Below are instructions to use the profile in non-production scenarios.

### Requirements

1. The entrypoint for the application must be through `/usr/bin/securedrop-client` with application code in `/opt/venvs/securedrop-client`.

2. The kernel must support AppArmor (running `sudo aa-status` will return zero if AppArmor is supported).

3. The `apparmor-utils` package is installed (`sudo apt install apparmor-utils` in Debian).

### Enabling AppArmor

1. Copy `files/usr.bin.securedrop-client` to `/etc/apparmor.d/`.

2. `sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.securedrop-client/`.

3. `sudo aa-status` and observe securedrop-client profile is being enforced.

### Testing and updating the AppArmor profile

1. Update the profile in `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.securedrop-client`.

2. `sudo aa-teardown`.

3. `sudo service apparmor restart`.

4. Once you've made all the changes necessary (e.g.: no apparmor errors in `/var/log/syslog`) you can copy `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.securedrop-client` into `files/usr.bin.securedrop-client` in this repository and commit the changes.

## Running tests and checks

There are two packages you'll have to install manually in order to run the entire test suite:

`apt install xvfb`
`apt install sqlite3`

We launch tests via `xvfb-run` on an `xvfb` X server in order to support machines with no display hardware, like we have in CircleCI. Even when running tests on a machine with display hardware, `xvfb` is useful in that it prevents a bunch of windows and dialogs from popping up on your desktop. If you want to run tests without `xvfb` then you can just uninstall it and run thet tests and checks as described below.

NOTE: `xvfb-run` will start and stop `xvfb` for you.

To run all tests and checks, run:

```bash
make check
```

To only run unit tests, run:

```bash
make test
```

To run unit tests in random order, run:

```bash
make test-random
```

To only run integration tests, run:

```bash
make test-integration
```

To only run functional tests, run:

```bash
make test-functional
```

### Functional Tests

When functional tests are run, they replay recorded API request and response data instead of making actual API calls to a server. This is why tests can pass even when there is no server running. If you want to add new tests that make API calls or if the SDK ever changes its API, then you'll need to record new request and response data by following the steps outlined in [Generating new cassettes](#generating-new-cassettes).

We use `qtbot`, bundled with the [pytest-qt](https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, for UI interaction within our functional tests.

#### Generating new cassettes

We use [vcrpy](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to record and replay API calls. Each request made from a test and response from the server is stored in a "cassette" yaml file in the `tests/functional/data` directory.

If the server changes its API, then you'll see the following warning indicating that a request failed to be found in an existing cassette and that you'll need to regenerate cassettes:

```
Can't overwrite existing cassette ('<path-to-cassette-for-a-functional-test>') in your current record mode ('once').
```

To set up a local dev server and generate cassettes, follow these steps:

1. Disable one TOTP check so that we can re-use the same one-time-code. You can do this by applying the following patch to the server code:

    ```
    diff --git a/securedrop/models.py b/securedrop/models.py
    index e70e492fc..bdbc55a06 100644
    --- a/securedrop/models.py
    +++ b/securedrop/models.py
    @@ -645,7 +645,7 @@ class Journalist(db.Model):

            # Reject OTP tokens that have already been used
            if self.last_token is not None and self.last_token == sanitized_token:

    +            pass

            if self.is_totp:
                # TOTP
    ```

2. Start the server in a docker container and add 5 sources with messages, files, and replies by running:

    ```bash
    NUM_SOURCES=5 make dev
    ```

3. Delete the cassettes you wish to regenerate or just delete the entire directory by running:

    ```bash
    rm -r tests/functional/data
    ```

4. Regenerate cassettes by running:

    ```bash
    make test-functional
    ```

Note: One of the functional tests deletes a source, so you may need to add it back or restart the server in between test runs where you are generating new cassettes.

## Making a Release

1. Update versions: `./update_version.sh $new_version_number` and add a new entry in the changelog.
2. Commit the changes with commit message `securedrop-client $new_version_number` and make a PR.
3. You should confirm via a manual debian package build and manual testing in Qubes that there are no regressions (this is limited pre-release QA).
4. Once your PR is approved, you can add a tag: `git tag -a $new_version_number`.
5. Perform the release signing ceremony on the tag. Push the tag.
6. The signer should create the source tarball via `python3 setup.py sdist`.
7. Add a detached signature (with the release key) for the source tarball.
8. Submit the source tarball and signature via PR into this [repository](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-builder) along with the debian changelog addition. This tarball and changelog will be used by the package builder.

## Debugging

To use `pdb`, add these lines:

```
from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtRemoveInputHook; pyqtRemoveInputHook()
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```
Then you can use [`pdb` commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) as normal.

Logs can be found in the `{sdc-home}/logs`. If you are debugging a version of this application installed from a deb package in Qubes, you can debug issues by looking at the log file in `~/.securedrop_client/logs/client.log`. You can also add additional log lines in the running code in
`/opt/venvs/securedrop-client/lib/python3.11/site-packages/securedrop_client/`.
