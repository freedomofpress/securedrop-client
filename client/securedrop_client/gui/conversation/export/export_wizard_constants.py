Export wizard page ordering, human-readable status messages

# Sequential list of pages (the enum value matters as a ranked ordering.)
# The reason the 'error' page is second is because the other pages have
# validation logic that means they can't be bypassed by QWizard::next.
# When we need to show an error, it's easier to go 'back' to the error
# page and set it to be a FinalPage than it is to try to skip the conditional
# pages. PyQt6 introduces behaviour that may deprecate this requirement.
