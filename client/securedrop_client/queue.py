    RunnableQueue maintains a priority queue and processes jobs in that queue. It continuously

    job type. If multiple jobs of the same type are added to the queue then they are retrieved
    in FIFO order.

    If a RequestTimeoutError or ServerConnectionError is encountered while processing a job, the
    job will be added back to the queue, the processing loop will stop, and the paused signal will
    be emitted. New jobs can still be added, but the processing function will need to be called
    again in order to resume. The processing loop is resumed when the resume signal is emitted.

    If an ApiInaccessibleError is encountered while processing a job, api_client will be set to
    None and the processing loop will stop. If the queue is resumed before the queue manager
    stops the queue thread, api_client will still be None and the next job will raise an
    ApiInaccessibleError before it makes an api call, which will repeat this process.

    Any other exception encountered while processing a job is unexpected, so the queue will drop the
    job and continue on to processing the next job. The job itself is responsible for emitting the
    success and failure signals, so when an unexpected error occurs, it should emit the failure
    signal so that the Controller can respond accordingly.
