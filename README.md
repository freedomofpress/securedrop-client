# securedrop-client
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofpress/securedrop-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofpress/securedrop-client)

Qt-based client for working with SecureDrop submissions on the SecureDrop Qubes Workstation. In Qubes, this application runs within a VM that has no direct network access, and files open in individual, non-networked, disposable VMs. API requests and responses to and from the SecureDrop application server are sent through an intermediate VM using the [Qubes SecureDrop proxy](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-proxy). For additional background, see the [main SecureDrop Workstation repository](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation), and read about the [user research and design work that informs this work](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/wiki/Qubes-Journalist-Workstation).

**IMPORTANT:** This project is in alpha and should not be used in production environments. There are known bugs which can be found in this projectâ€™s issue tracker.

# Current limitations

This client is under active development and currently supports a minimal feature set. Major supported features include:

- the download and decryption of files, messages, and replies (using [Qubes split-gpg](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/))
- the display of decrypted messages and replies in a new conversation view
- the opening of all files in individual, non-networked, Qubes disposable VMs
- replying to sources
- deleting sources

Features to be added include:

- Export workflows - tracked in https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/issues/21. These workflows (initially a USB drive) enable a journalist to transfer a document out of the Qubes workstation and to another computer for further analysis or sharing with the rest of the newsroom.

## Getting Started

Set up a Python 3 virtual environment and set up dependencies:

```
virtualenv --python=python3.5 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --require-hashes -r dev-requirements.txt
```

Please install system libraries for PyQt rather than using PyPI-managed libraries- this makes packaging possible later. On Debian, `apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtsvg` will install what you need.

In order to run the test suite you should also install the `xvfb` package (to
make the `xvfb-run` command available): `apt install xvfb`.

### OSX

```
# install Homebrew https://brew.sh/

brew install pyenv
# follow step 3 onwards of https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout
pyenv install 3.5.3

brew install pip
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python=python3.5.3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --require-hashes -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Updating dependencies

If you're adding or updating a dependency, you need to:

1. Modify either `dev-requirements.in` and `requirements.in` (depending on whether it is prod or dev only) and then run `make update-pip-dependencies`. This will generate `dev-requirements.txt` and `requirements.txt`.

2. For building a debian package from this project, we use the requirements in
`build-requirements.txt` which uses our pip mirror, i.e. the hashes in that file point to
wheels on our pip mirror. A maintainer will need to add
the updated dependency to our pip mirror (you can request this in the PR).

3. Once the pip mirror is updated, you should checkout the [securedrop-debian-packaging repo](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging) and run `make requirements`. Commit the `build-requirements.txt` that results and add it to your PR.

## Run the client

You can then run the client with an ephemeral data directory:

```
./run.sh
```

If you want to persist data across restarts, you will need to run the client with:

```
./run.sh --sdc-home /path/to/my/dir/
```

## Debugging

To use `pdb`, add these lines:

```
from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtRemoveInputHook; pyqtRemoveInputHook()
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```
Then you can use [`pdb` commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) as normal.

## Running against a test server

In order to login, or take other actions involving network access, you will need to use the SecureDrop server dev container.

Follow the instructions [in the SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html#quick-start) to set that up.

The client uses the [SecureDrop SDK](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-sdk) to interact with the [SecureDrop Journalist API](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/journalist_api.html).
After you run the server container, the journalist interface API will be running on `127.0.0.1:8081` with a test journalist, admin, and test sources and replies.

To ensure that file decryption works, please import [this test private key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/0a901362b84a5378fba80e9cd0ffe4542bdcd598/securedrop/tests/files/test_journalist_key.sec) into your GnuPG keyring. Submissions in the SecureDrop server dev environment can be decrypted with this test key.

## Run the tests and checks

To run everything, run:

```bash
make check
```

## Comparison of developer environments

### Developer environment on non-Qubes

* Ran by `run.sh`
* Uses temporary configuration directories by default
* Requests/responses to the Journalist API are sent directly via HTTP (and Tor is not used)
* Does not use `split-gpg`

### Developer environment on Qubes

* Ran by directly invoking the client `python -m securedrop_client`.
* Requires that `make all` in the `securedrop-workstation` repository has completed successfully
* Uses `~/.securedrop_client` as its configuration directory
* Requests/responses proxied via the `securedrop-proxy` RPC service (and Tor is used)
* `split-gpg` is used with the key configured in the `sd-gpg` AppVM

### Packaged code on Qubes

* Requires that `make all` in the `securedrop-workstation` repository has completed successfully
* Uses `~/.securedrop_client` as its configuration directory
* Requests/responses proxied via the `securedrop-proxy` RPC service (and Tor is used)
* `split-gpg` is used with the key configured in the `sd-gpg` AppVM
* Using a version of this application installed from a deb package in Qubes,
you can debug issues by looking at the log file in
`~/.securedrop_client/logs/client.log`
* You can also add additional log lines in the running code in
`/opt/venvs/securedrop-client/lib/python3.5/site-packages/securedrop_client/`

## Generate and run database migrations

```bash
rm -f svs.sqlite
sqlite3 svs.sqlite .databases > /dev/null
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your revision here"
```

### Merging Migrations

This project aims to have at most one migration per release. There may be cases where this is not feasible,
but developers should merge their migration into the latest migration that has been generated since the last
release. The above mentioned autogenerate command will not do this for you.

## Making a Release

**Note:** These are the release guidelines for pre-production alpha releases. Production release tags must
be signed with the SecureDrop release key.

1. Update versions: `./update_version.sh $new_version_number` and add a new entry in the changelog.
2. Commit the changes with commit message `securedrop-client $new_version_number` and make a PR.
3. You should confirm via a manual debian package build and manual testing in Qubes that there are no regressions (this is limited pre-release QA).
4. Once your PR is approved, you can add a tag and push: `git tag $new_version_number`.
