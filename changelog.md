# Pre-consolidation changelogs

Prior to December 2023, most Debian packages required by the SecureDrop Workstation had
their own dedicated Git repository. Version numbers were advanced individually, and
separate changelogs were maintained for each package.

For additional background on this monorepo consolidation, see our [January 2024 blog post](https://securedrop.org/news/consolidating-securedrop-workstations-git-repositories-to-make-development-easier/).

The changelogs for each component prior to the consolidation can be found below.

The `securedrop-sdk` was distributed as a Python package on PyPI. Its changelog is also
included.
